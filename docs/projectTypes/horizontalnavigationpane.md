# Horizontal Navigation Pane

Tabs across the top allow for quickly navigating between pages and leave a lot of space to the app content.

This is recommended if you have 5 or fewer top level navigation items that are equally important.

This project type is based on the same control ([`NavigationView`](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/design/controls-and-patterns/navigationview)) as the [Navigation Pane](./navigationpane.md) type but with the `PaneDisplayMode` set to `Top`.

Early versions of WinTS used the `Pivot` control in the shell page. There are [instructions for migrating projects built with a version that used the Pivot control to convert it to use `NavigationView`](./updatetohorizontalnavview.md).
