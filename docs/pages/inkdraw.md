# Ink Draw

This page contains an ink canvas and an ink toolbar that allows you to draw using Windows Ink. You can select parts of your drawing, move the selection, copy, cut and paste it. You can open and save your drawings as gif and export it as png file. This page also supports undo/redo of all actions.
