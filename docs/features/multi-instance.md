# Multi-Instance

Allow multiple instances of the app to be launched. This version will always create a new instance of the app each time it is launched.

This feature will only have an affect if your app is running on a Desktop or Internet of Things (IoT) device.

Please note that the [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/launch-resume/multi-instance-uwp) has specific notes you should be aware of if you are using [background tasks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/launch-resume/multi-instance-uwp#background-tasks-and-multi-instancing) as well as [general considerations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/launch-resume/multi-instance-uwp#additional-considerations).

There is also an [advanced version of this feature](./multi-instance-advanced.md) that contains extra functionality.
