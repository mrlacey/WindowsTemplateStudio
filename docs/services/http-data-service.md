# HTTP Data Service

A simple wrapper over basic HTTP functionality.

These utility functions provide a simple, built-in way to handle most HTTP related functionality within your app. Also includes simple caching of GET requests that can easily be removed or modified based on your needs.

This service works well when getting content from a [Web API](./web-api.md).
