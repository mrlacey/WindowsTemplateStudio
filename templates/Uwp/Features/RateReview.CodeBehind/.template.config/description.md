Add a link to the settings page that will open a dialog to capture reviews and ratings for your app in the store.

This is an alternative to [launching the store app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/launch-resume/launch-store-app) for the review or rating to be entered.

Note. This functionality can only be used in apps distributed through the store.
