XAML Styler is a visual studio extension, which formats XAML source code by sorting the attributes based on their importance. This tool can help you/your team maintain a better XAML coding style as well as a much better XAML readability.

This feature adds a default configuration file to the project to help you define the way your XAML should be defined.

Note. You must have the [XAMLStyler extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamXavalon.XAMLStyler) installed to make use of this feature.
