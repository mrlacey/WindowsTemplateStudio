This page contains an ink canvas and an ink toolbar that allows you to draw using Windows ink.
This page uses InkAnalyzer and allows you to select the nodes and transform them into shapes and texts. You can also move the nodes or use lasso selection to select a part of a node and move only those strokes. This page also supports undo/redo of all actions.
